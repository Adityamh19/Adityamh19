### These days I’m focused on:

- 📊 End-to-end machine learning projects using Python  
- 🧠 Data analysis, feature engineering, and model evaluation  
- 🔍 Turning raw data into clear, actionable insights  
- ✨ Small, thoughtful projects with real-world relevance

### Some stuff I built:

- 🩺 **Liver Disease AI Predictor**  
  An end-to-end machine learning system that analyzes patient biomarker data to classify liver disease into five stages using XGBoost and Random Forest.

- 🧑‍💼 **Customer Personality Analysis & Prediction**  
  A machine learning pipeline that segments customers into distinct personas using K-Means clustering and predicts behavior using Random Forest models.

- 🧪 **Data Science & ML Mini Projects**  
  A collection of hands-on projects including spam classifiers, preprocessing utilities, and small ML applications developed through continuous practice.
