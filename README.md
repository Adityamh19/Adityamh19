Hi there! 👋

I’m Aditya, a **Data Science & Machine Learning Engineer** based in India.  
I enjoy working with data, building practical machine learning systems, and keeping solutions clean, structured, and easy to understand.

These days I’m focused on:

📊 End-to-end machine learning projects using Python  
🧠 Data analysis, feature engineering, and model evaluation  
🔍 Turning raw data into clear, actionable insights  
✨ Small, thoughtful projects with real-world relevance  

Some stuff I built:

🩺 **Liver Disease AI Predictor**  
An end-to-end machine learning system that analyzes patient biomarker data to classify liver disease into five stages using XGBoost and Random Forest models.

🧑‍💼 **Customer Personality Analysis & Prediction**  
A machine learning pipeline that segments customers into distinct personas using K-Means clustering and predicts customer behavior using Random Forest.

🧪 **Data Science & ML Mini Projects**  
A collection of hands-on data science and machine learning projects, including spam classifiers, preprocessing utilities, and small ML applications developed through practical experimentation.

Things I work with:

🐍 Python · SQL · Pandas · NumPy  
📈 Scikit-learn · Matplotlib · Seaborn  
🧠 Machine Learning · EDA · Feature Engineering · NLP (basics)  
🛠️ Git · Linux (basics) · Docker (basics) · Jupyter Notebook  

Background:

🏢 **Student Intern — Python ML Foundation (VTUxRooman)**  
🧪 Gained hands-on experience working on real-world data science and machine learning projects  
🐧 Comfortable working in Linux environments and Git-based workflows  

Fun facts:

💪 I am highly consistent and don’t quit easily  
🧩 I enjoy breaking down complex problems and explaining them in a way even a beginner can understand  
📘 I like improving systems through continuous iteration and learning  
😇 I naturally motivate others through clear, confident, and effective communication  
🧠 I value clarity — in code, data, and thinking
